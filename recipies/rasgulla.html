    <ol>
        <li><P>Mix water, sugar and cardamom powder in a cooker/big vessel and boil. Let the sugar dissolve first.</p></li>
        <li><p>When the sugar syrup is boiling, drop the balls gently into the hot sugar syrup. See to it that they do not touch each other.Cook on high flames for 7-8 minutes with lid closed.</p></li>
        <li><p>After that, open the lid, add 2-3 tbsp of the maida water and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Now again add 2 tbsp of plain hot water to the boiling syrup. Adding a little hot water from time to time prevents the sugar syrup from getting thicker.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook for another 3-4 minutes or till the balls are cooked. When you press the rasgullas slightly, it must return to its original shape, then it is an indication that it is cooked.</p></li>
        <li><p>Let it be in the cooker until it cools down.
            Refrigerate for 3 hours and serve cold. If needed garnish with slivered almonds and finely chopped pistachio.
